 BRIDGE-TOURCH
   ---------

first 1 and 2 minute go together cross the bridge ( it takes 2 minute)
and 1 bring the torch back to 7 and 10 ( total 3 minute now) and 7 and 10 cross together (it takes 10 minute)
and 2 bring the torch back to 1  (now total minute taken is 15 minute).
Now 1 and 2 again cross the bridge together (takes 2 min) and everybody reached the other side 
The total time taken should be 17 minute 

REASONING

7 and 10 should cross together so that long time come only once. 1 and 2 should be the returners because they take the least mount of time
